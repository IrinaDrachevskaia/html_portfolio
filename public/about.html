<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Irina. 
  <br/>
  I was born in Moscow, Russia. 
  I graduated with honors from Moscow University, 
  specializing in Financial Management. I had a successful
   career in finance and eventually became the head of the 
   Budgeting Department and the Deputy Head of the
    Financial Department.

<p>Then I got married and moved to London, UK. 
  Since the move, I have been on maternity leave. 
  My husband and I have amazing kids: a girl and a boy 
  with a 2-year age gap. They are school-aged now.</p>

<p>Last year, I made the decision to live my life 
  and try something new, something that interests me. 
  And here I am, studying coding with Angela.</p>
